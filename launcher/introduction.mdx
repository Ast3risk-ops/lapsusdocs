This launcher is a fork of Westeros (designed for modded servers). It has Forge "presets" (Westeros server presets, designed for use with servers requiring specific modloaders and mods, not end users) and as such you cannot freely install modloaders. In fact, they don't even support Forge for the latest version of Minecraft as the presets must be manually updated by a maintainer.

"Next-generation" my ass. Just use [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org) for God's sake.
