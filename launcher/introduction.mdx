This launcher is a fork of Westeros (designed for modded servers). 

It has "presets" (Westeros server presets, designed for use with servers requiring specific modloaders and mods, not end users) and as such you cannot freely install modloaders, you must use these specfic presets. 
In fact, they don't even support Forge for the latest version of Minecraft as the presets must be manually updated by a maintainer.

<Info>You also can't play vanilla Minecraft (it *must* be Forge).</Info>

In terms of features, there are none whatsoever. Drag and drop mods in like the vanilla launcher, manage accounts, that's it.

"Next-generation" my ass. Just use [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org) for God's sake. It has so many more useful features and was actually designed for users. It's way faster (it's not electron) and even installs Java for you now.
