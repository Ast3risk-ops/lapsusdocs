    <Step title="Set the name and logo" icon="id-card" iconType="solid">
        ```json settings.json
        "name": "Lapsus Client",
          "logo": {
            "url": "/assets/img/logo_background.png"
          },
        ```

          "port": 8000,
          "secret": "changeme"
        },
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Pterodactyl details" icon="gamepad" iconType="sharp-solid">
       ```json settings.json
       "pterodactyl": {
          "domain": "https://panel.yourdomain.com",
          "key": "ptla_",
          "account_key": "ptlc_"
        },
       ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Discord OAuth settings" icon="discord" iconType="brands">
       ```json settings.json
       "oauth2": {
          "_comment": "Go to https://discord.dev/ and create an application to set these up.",
          "id": "",
          "secret": "",
          "link": "http://localhost:8080",
       ```
       Then add the redirect to your Discord Developer portal (covered in more detail in the Discord section)
       <Frame caption="On the Discord Developer Portal, your redirect must end with /callback.">
