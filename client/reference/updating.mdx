When an update is available, the updater section of the client (only for admins) shows your current version and the latest version. It will show you a button which will redirect you to the latest version on GitHub to download.

Click `Source Code (zip)` under **Assets** and **BACK UP YOUR SETTINGS.JSON**. Extract the new client over the old one, then copy your backed up `settings.json` into the client folder. Restart the client.
