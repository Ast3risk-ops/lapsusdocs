## Login

Head on over to the [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.

![Click Create](/assets/img/createapp.png)

Give it a name and create it under **Personal** (or a team it doesn't really matter).

Set your app's name and icon, this is what users will see on the login screen. Set a TOS and Privacy Policy URL if your host has them, these will also be shown at login.

![Set the above app details](/assets/img/appdetails.png)

Next go to **OAuth2**, then add a **Redirect**. This redirect should be the URL to your client (the public one, set as `oauth2.link`) with `/callback`.

Example:

![\<YOUR_CLIENT_URL\>/callback](/assets/img/oauth2redirect.png)

Next copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

![This image just shows where that is](/assets/img/clientid.png)

Configure everything in [`config.json`](/client/reference/config) now:


```json config.json
      "oauth2": {
        "_comment": "Go to https://discord.dev/ and create an application to set these up.",
        "id": "APPLICATION_ID",
        "secret": "YOUR_SECRET",
        "link": "https://YOUR_DOMAIN",
        // Rest of file
```
