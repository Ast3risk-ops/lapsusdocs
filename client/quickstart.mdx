## Requirements

- A **server** running a [supported OS and NodeJS version](/client/reference/os-support)
- A **Pterodactyl-compatible** panel

## Installation

<Steps titleSize="h3">
<Step title="Run the installation script">
<Note>This script is for Debian-based Linux systems only and requires you to be logged in as `root`.</Note>
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lapsusdevs/script/main/manager.sh)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Edit essential settings">
  To get a quick basic panel up, you need to change a few things in [`config.json`](/client/reference/config):
<commonSettings />
</Step>
<Step title="Start the client">
  Now run `node .` in the same folder. You should see something like this:

  ![Terminal window of a successful install, should have a URL](/assets/img/terminal.png)
  
  Login using the URL shown in the terminal:
  <Frame>
  ![Login window](/assets/img/lapsus.jpg)
  </Frame>
